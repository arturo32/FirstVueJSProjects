Learning and practicing VueJS

## Comments
First project in VueJS. I followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSa-SMVMGsE">this video</a> to make it both in CDN (all project in a single HMTL file) and CLI (complete project with separate component files)versions. You can add comments to a list with or without author (Anonymous) and delete them later. <br/>

## Converter
I got inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIEa3MRBpI0&t=1820s">this video</a> to make this currency converter. I made it show the value converted instantly as the user types in the input boxes. I also made a main input box with a dropdown list ("stole" and adapted from <a href="https://github.com/arturo32/arturo32.github.io">my other project</a>) for the user to be able to choose a base currency that it's present in every other "converter box". <br/>
